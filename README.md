One may use torrc from this repo. Pay your attention on lines 36 and 37. Line 36 (u may comment this one) sets the first tor node; line 37 sets the exit nodes to avoid; for instatnt there are exit nodes one should avoid if one is in opposite to russia and it's political and economical partners.
And input two letters international country code.
Also one should preinstall flags-svg (strings 38,44,50 in exit_node_handling.sh and strings 22,28 in checkIP.sh). We talk about parrot os for example.
This script is modified anonsurf version; so one should install anonsurfd (or just use Parrot OS).
